In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.

You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

Example 1:
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2,3,4]]
Explanation:
The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.
Example 2:
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 2, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
Explanation:
There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.
Note:
The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].
The given r and c are all positive.
//方法一:其实就是按顺序把原来的数列的数取下来，然后放进新的维度的数列。问题很简单。O(m*n)，这个时间复杂度没办法降低了
class Solution {
public:
	vector<vector<int>> matrixReshape(vector<vector<int>>& nums,const int r,const int c) {
		auto m = nums.size();//原本的行列
		auto n = nums[0].size();
		if (m*n != r*c)
			return nums;
		else {
			vector<int> element;
			for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
				for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
					element.push_back(nums[i][j]);
			int k = 0;//记录总元素位置
			vector<vector<int>> newNums;
			vector<int> row;
			for (int i = 0; i < r; ++i) {
				for (int j = 0; j < c; ++j) {
					row.push_back(element[k]);
					++k;
				}
				newNums.push_back(row);
				row.clear();
			}
			return newNums;
		}
	}
};
